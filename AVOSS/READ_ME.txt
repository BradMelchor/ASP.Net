The Alachua Vet Online Software System (AVOSS) is a web application that reduces administrative tasks 
in veterinary offices by allowing customers to schedule, change, and cancel their own vet appointments 
online. Customers can view appointments and medical information for each of their pets. In addition, the 
system provides veterinary staff with several different views of scheduled appointments. The list view 
pairs appointment data with corresponding customer and medical data for each scheduled pet. Veterinary 
staff members have different permission levels, depending on their roles.  This allows vet technicians to 
add, update, and delete medical data such as vital signs, while the system limits the entry of more 
advanced medical information, such as diagnoses, to vets. In addition to limiting data entry by role, AVOSS 
secures data through authentication, hashing, and encryption. As a web application, the software requires 
a database and web server. For more information about installation and use, consult the "Help" menu on the 
AVOSS website.
